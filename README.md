# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# Self-Introduction ðŸŽ€

Iâ€™m Inzhu, a behavioral science student currently studying at Hokkaido University, I focus on topics like cultural psychology, learning processes, and human cognition.

With an international background and experience living in several countries, Iâ€™m especially drawn to cross-cultural research and how behavioral patterns differ across societies. 

Outside of my studies, Iâ€™m interested in language learning, fashion, and exploring diverse perspectives through traveling.
